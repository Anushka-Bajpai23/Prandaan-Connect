- Donor and recipient registration pages
- Live matches dashboard with urgency indicators
- Compatibility scores predicted using a local ML model
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Responsive and accessible UI

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## AI Logic

The compatibility prediction model is trained in-browser using TensorFlow.js. It takes three inputs:

- Urgency level (mapped to score)
- Organ match flag (1 if matching organ)

Predicted score is scaled to 0â€“100% and used for visualization only.
